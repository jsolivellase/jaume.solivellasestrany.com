Since I was a child, the idea of writing a blog has attracted me. During my adolescence, at the beginning of the 21st century, the popularity of blogging skyrocketed. Anyway, I didn't have the technical skills to start the journey, but with the inception of some companies like *Blogger* or *WordPress.com* at the beginning of the two thousand, the creation of blogs was democratized, making it accessible to anyone. That's why I tried to open my personal blog, but I didn't manage to write and publish anything. It was not until 2010 when I was encouraged to create my first blog and publish some posts. It didn't go far away—after a couple of months—I stopped writing because I didn't have any idea of what to write about.

I have always struggled with writing. It's not an activity that I have developed throughout the course of the years, not in secondary school nor in the university studying my computer engineering degree. I don't have a creative mind; probably that's why I ended up studying a degree in engineering.

Anyway, we are here to put an end to it once and for all. All of my previous attempts at writing a blog were with the objective of creating a personal brand, forcing me to write about topics where I wasn't interested or where I just did not feel like writing.

One more time I am in the same situation, trying to write a personal blog that persists on time, but this time, **the main objective of the blog is to make a habit of writing while I am enjoying the path**, without pressure, without trying to prove something to anyone or make of this project something profitable.

Welcome to my personal blog, where I will write about whatever comes to mind, without any kind of criteria or coherence, coffee, mechanical keyboards, coding, photography, personal opinions…
